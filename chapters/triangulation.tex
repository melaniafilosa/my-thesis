\chapter{The triangulation refinement}\label{chap:triangulation}
The purpose of this chapter is to provide an alternative approach to the $\alpha$-shapes methods for determining the boundaries $\partial \mbox{\set{R}{}{}}(\Pi)$ in target PS. 
Our method is based on the triangulation refinement of the source PS explained in Section \ref{chap:PS}.The chapter begins with the general explanation of the method. Then, numerical results are provided for three optical systems: the two-faceted cup, the TIR-collimator and a parabolic reflector. The PS method is compared to both MC and QMC ray tracing. Discussion and results are provided in the last section of this chapter.
\section{The method}
In Chapter \ref{chap:PS}, we have seen that, using the triangulation refinement, more rays close to the boundaries are traced selecting increasingly smaller values for the parameters $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}}$ and $\varepsilon_{\variabile{p}_1}^{\textrm{min}}$. Once the algorithm stops, only the triangles that are expected to be crossed by a boundary are taken into account. By construction, each of these triangles has two vertices that follow the same path and one vertex that follows another path.
The triangles are ordered in such a way that two of them are neighbors if they have a side in common. Given a path $\Pi$ the corresponding boundary $\partial\mbox{\set{R}{$1$}{}}(\Pi)$ on \set{S}{}{} is approximated by those vertices of the triangles which corresponding rays follow path $\Pi$. The edge-ray principle is employed in order to define the boundaries at the tareget.
The boundaries $\partial \mbox{\set{R}{}{}}(\Pi)$ at the target are given by
\begin{equation}\map{M}{}{}(\partial\mbox{\set{R}{}{}}(\Pi)):\partial\mbox{\set{R}{$1$}{}}(\Pi)\rightarrow\partial\mbox{{R}{}{}}(\Pi),\end{equation}
where $\map{M}{}{}$ is defined in Equation (\ref{eq:map1}), and $\map{M}{}{}(\partial\mbox{\set{R}{}{}}(\Pi))$ is the restriction of $\map{M}{}{}$ to $\partial\mbox{\set{R}{}{}}(\Pi)$ for every path 
$\Pi$. \\\indent In this chapter we develop a criterion to establish the value of the parameters $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}}$, $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{max}}$, $\varepsilon_{\variabile{p}_1}^{\textrm{min}}$ and $\varepsilon_{\variabile{p}_1}^{\textrm{max}}$ that gives a good approximation of $\partial \mbox{\set{R}{}{}}(\Pi)$.
 Similar to what it was done for selecting $\alpha$ in the $\alpha$-shapes procedure, 
in order to select the triangulation parameters we use the \'{e}tendue conservation as an area in PS. The core of our approach is the following.\\
\indent The \'{e}tendue $U_1$ at the source PS \set{S}{}{} related to all the rays that arrive at the target is calculated. If all the rays emitted by the source are received by the target, $U_1$ can be easily determined by using Equation (\ref{eq:etenduesource}), otherwise Equation (\ref{eq:etenduesumsource}) needs to be computed. 
\\ \indent The \'{e}tendue $U_{\textrm{t}}$ at the target PS \set{T}{}{} is calculated using Equations (\ref{eq:etendueintegraltarget}) and (\ref{eq:etenduetarg1}).
To calculate the integral in Equation (\ref{eq:etenduetarg1}), the triangulation refinement method is applied to the regions $\mbox{\set{R}{}{}}(\Pi)$ for a range of values of $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{max}}$ and for a fixed value of $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}}$. The parameters along the $\variabile{p}$-axis are scaled as $\varepsilon_{\variabile{p}_1}^{\textrm{max}} = \varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{max}}/w$ and 
$\varepsilon_{\variabile{p}_1}^{\textrm{min}}  = \varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}}/w$ with 
$w = (\variabile{p}_1^{\textrm{max}}-\variabile{p}_1^{\textrm{min}})/(\variabile{q}_1^{\textrm{max}}-\variabile{q}_1^{\textrm{min}})$ where 
$\variabile{p}_1^{\textrm{min}}$ and $\variabile{p}_1^{\textrm{max}}$ are the minimum and the maximum $\variabile{p}$-coordinate in \set{S}{}{}, respectively, and 
$\variabile{q}_1^{\textrm{min}}$ and $\variabile{q}_1^{\textrm{max}}$ are the minimum and the maximum $\variabile{q}$-coordinate in \set{S}{}{}, respectively.
An approximation of the boundaries $\partial\mbox{\set{R}{}{}}(\Pi)$ is obtained for each of those parameters values.
Then, the intersection points $(\variabile{q}^{\variabile{i}}( \Pi, \variabile{p}), \Pi)_{\variabile{i} = 1, \cdots, \variabile{r}}$ between $\partial\mbox{\set{R}{}{}}(\Pi)$
and the horizontal line $\variabile{p}~=~ const$ are calculated for each path $\Pi$, and for $\variabile{p}~\in~[-1,1]$. Ordering their $\variabile{q}$-coordinates in ascending order, the integral in Equation (\ref{eq:etenduetarg1}) is computed.
Changing the values of the parameters, different approximations of $\partial\mbox{\set{R}{}{}}(\Pi)$ are found and, consequently, different values of $U_{\textrm{t}}$.
\\ \indent In order to use the parameters that give a good accuracy of the target photometric variables, the difference $\Delta U = U_1-U_{\textrm{t}}$ is calculated for every value of $U_{\textrm{t}}$ found. The values of the parameters that give a small $\Delta U$ provide a triangulation refinement from which a good approximation of the target photometric variables.
\\ \indent A similar method as described here is presented by Moore, \cite{moore2013methods}. In Moore's method each ray leaves the source at the same position while the angle coordinate changes. The path followed by the rays is taken into account and an interpolation is required to finalize the illumination pattern.
 This interpolation can affect the efficiency of the method. Our method employs the distribution of the rays at the target phase space and avoids using any interpolation. Moreover, a criterion to stop the algorithm is provided in such a way that no more rays than necessary are traced. This makes ray tracing in PS more accurate compared to Moore's procedure. \\ \indent
The triangulation refinement method is tested for several optical systems. The results are presented next.
\section{The two-faceted cup}
In this paragraph we apply the triangulation refinement in PS to the two-faceted cup described in Chapter \ref{chap:raytracing} and depicted in Figure \ref{fig:cup}. 
We start tracing rays inside the system using PS ray tracing as explained in Chapter \ref{chap:PS}. To avoid rays parallel to the source and that leave the endpoints, we consider rays with initial position $\variabile{q}_1$ and initial direction $\variabile{p}_1$ such that 
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
\variabile{p}_1&\in[-1+10^{-6},1-10^{-6}] = [\variabile{p}_1^{\textrm{min}}, \variabile{p}_1^{\textrm{max}}] \\ 
\variabile{q}_1&\in[-2+10^{-12}, 2-10^{-12}] = [\variabile{q}_1^{\textrm{min}}, \variabile{q}_1^{\textrm{max}}].
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*} 
A stopping criterion for the triangulation is defined using \'{e}tendue conservation. Since the two-faceted cup is formed by only reflective lines and its target is adjacent to the left and the right reflector (it is located exactly at the top of the system),  all the rays emitted by the source arrive to the target. Thus, 
\begin{equation}U_1 = U = 4(2-10^{-12})(1-10^{-6})\approx 8, \end{equation}
where the second equality follows using in Equation (\ref{eq:etenduesource}) $\n_1\sin(\myangle_1^{\textrm{max}})=\variabile{p}_1^\textrm{max}$ and $\variabile{a}=\variabile{q}_1^{\textrm{max}}$. To establish the number of rays needed to achieve a good accuracy of the target intensity, we compare the approximated $U_{\textrm{t}}$, obtained from a given number of rays, to the exact \'{e}tendue $U=U_1$. 
To this purpose, ray tracing in PS is implemented by varying the parameter $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}}$, and fixing  $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{max}}$ (we choose $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{max}}=1$), the other two parameters are given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:parameters_cup}
\begin{aligned} 
\varepsilon_{\variabile{p}_1}^{\textrm{max}} &= \varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{max}}/w, \\
\varepsilon_{\variabile{p}_1}^{\textrm{min}}&= \varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}}/w,
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
with $w= (\variabile{p}_1^{\textrm{max}}-\variabile{p}_1^{\textrm{min}})/(\variabile{q}_1^{\textrm{max}}-\variabile{q}_1^{\textrm{min}})\approx 2.$ 
Every set of parameters give a different triangulation a the source PS \set{S}{}{}. The approximated boundaries are computed for several triangulation joining the vertices of the triangles crossed by a boundary that follow the same path $\Pi$ (from now on we refer to these triangle as the \textit{boundary triangles}).

\caption{\textbf{Boundaries at \set{S}{}{} and \set{T}{}{} of the two-faceted cup.} The approximated boundaries are computed using the triangulation refinement with two different values of $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{max}}$.}
\label{fig:boundaries_cup}
\end{figure} 
\\ \indent In order to understand which value of  $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}}$ gives the best approximation of the boundaries and, consequently, of the target photometric variable, we calculate $U_{\textrm{t}}$ for the every set of rays traced using Equation (\ref{eq:etenduetarg1}). Then the difference 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:delta} \Delta U = U_1-U_{\textrm{t}} 
\end{equation} is found.
An accurate approximation of $U_{\textrm{t}}$ gives a small value of $\Delta U$. 
\\ \indent For example, if we consider $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}}=0.1$, $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{max}}=1$ and the parameters for the $\variabile{p}$-axis given by Equation (\ref{eq:parameters_cup}), a triangulation with around $1500$ rays (vertices of the triangles) is found. The boundaries $\partial$\set{R}{$1$}{}$(\Pi)$ and $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$ are calculated using this triangulation refinement which are depicted in black in Figures \ref{fig:boundaries_s2} and \ref{fig:boundaries_t2}, respectively. For this set of rays we found $\Delta U \approx 0.53 $. Then we can decrease $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}}$ to obtain more precise approximation of $U_{\textrm{t}}$. Varying $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}} = 0.025$ while remaining unchanged the other parameters, a triangulation formed by around $7500$ rays is obtained. The approximated boundaries $\partial$\set{R}{$1$}{}$(\Pi)$ and $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$ are depicted with black lines in Figures \ref{fig:boundaries_s1} and \ref{fig:boundaries_t1}, respectively. The approximation of the target \'{e}tendue gives $\Delta U \approx 0.13 $.
 This give the insight that the boundaries computation obtained using $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}} = 0.025$ is more accurate. 
Note that, decreasing $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}}$, the number of rays increases. 
\\ \indent In Figure \ref{fig:etendue_cup} we show with the blue line how the target \'{e}tendue varies as a function of the parameter $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}}$ where the other parameter have always a fixed value. The exact \'{e}tendue $U=8$ is depicted with the red line and it is computed using Equation (\ref{eq:etenduetarg1}). By decreasing $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}}$ an increase of $U_{\textrm{t}}$ is observed. Furthermore, by construction, $U_{\textrm{t}}$ is always underestimated because the approximated boundaries are found joining the vertices of the \textit{boundaries triangles} which are \textit{inside} the regions \set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$.

  \label{fig:etendue_cup}
\end{figure}
Referring as Figure \ref{fig:etendue_cup}, the best approximation of $U_{\textrm{t}}$ is obtained tracing around $1.2 \cdot 10^5$ rays using PS ray tracing with parameters $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}}=0.8\cdot 10^{-4}$, $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{max}}=1$, $\varepsilon_{\variabile{p}_1}^{\textrm{min}}=\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}}/2$ and $\varepsilon_{\variabile{p}_1}^{\textrm{max}}= \varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{max}}/2$. 
\\ \indent The PS intensity $\hat{I}_{PS}$ with $1.2 \cdot 10^5$ rays is calculated using Equation (\ref{eta2}). The intensity profile is shown in Figure \ref{fig:intensity_cup_triangulation} with the red line. In the same graph we show the reference intensity $\hat{I}_{\textrm{ref}}$ with the dotted blue line. For the two-faceted cup the reference intensity is actually the exact intensity ($\hat{I}_{\textrm{ref}}= \hat{I}_{\textrm{exact}}$).

Around $1.2 \cdot 10^5$ rays are traced.}
  \label{fig:intensity_cup_triangulation}
\end{figure}
\\ \indent 
Finally, we compare PS ray tracing with both MC and QMC ray tracing by computing the error between the approximated intensities $\hat{I}_{\textrm{A}}  (\textrm{A}= \textrm{MC}, \textrm{QMC}, \textrm{PS})$ and the exact intensity $\hat{I}_{\textrm{ref}}$. For the error calculation we use Equation (\ref{eq:error}) with $\nbin = 100$. The results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:error_cup_triangulation} where MC, QMC and PS intensity are depicted with the green, blue and red line, respectively.

Using PS ray tracing far less rays need to be traced compared to MC ray tracing but still more rays than QMC ray tracing are needed.}
  \label{fig:error_cup_triangulation}
\end{figure}
The graph shows that using PS and the triangulation refinement for the boundaries computation requires tracing far less rays compared to MC ray tracing.
While, an error comparison between QMC ray tracing and PS ray tracing shows that more rays are needed in PS. Indeed, on one hand the triangulation refinement we always underestimate the value of the \'{e}tendue at the target. Although, the shapes of all the regions \set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$ are very smooth, their boundaries at the edge of the target phase space \set{T}{}{} are difficult to approximate by triangles. With the triangulation refinement, as far as is fine the triangulation, the vertical and straight lines at the edge of \set{T}{}{} are always approximate by a broken line. On the other hand, since the two-faceted cup is a very simple system, QMC ray tracing does not requires a huge number of rays to obtain the desired accuracy. \\ \indent Nevertheless, PS ray tracing has a big advantage compared to QMC ray tracing. Indeed, as we have seen in Chapter \ref{chap:raytracing}, MC and QMC ray tracing are binning procedure. Therefore, the MC and QMC intensities are given by the average over every bin and the error also depends on the number of bins. This part of the error is not included in the results provided in Figure \ref{fig:error_cup_triangulation} as there we have fixed the number of bins $\nbin = 100$. % according to Equations \ref{} \ref{}
PS ray tracing gives a pointwise intensity along all the possible directions. In the simulations shown in this thesis we always compute the average PS intensity. This is needed to give a fair comparison of PS ray tracing with MC and QMC ray tracing. It is very important to observe that no error related to the number of bins is involved in the PS procedure. \\ \indent
In order to investigate in more details the PS ray tracing performances, we test the method for more complicated systems. In the next paragraph we present the results for a TIR-collimator. 
\section{A TIR-collimator}
In this section we provide the results of PS ray tracing for a TIR-collimator, using the triangulation refinement to compute the boundaries $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$ in target PS. In particular, we consider the TIR-collimator depicted in Figure \ref{fig:analyticlens}. Since this system is located in two different media (air and glass), also refraction law plays a role in the ray tracing procedure. We implement PS ray tracing for the TIR-collimator several times gradually increasing the number of rays, i.e. gradually decreasing the values of the parameters $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}}, \varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{max}}, \varepsilon_{\variabile{p}_1}^{\textrm{min}}$ and $\varepsilon_{\variabile{p}_1}^{\textrm{max}}$ in the triangulation. In order to trace more rays close to the boundaries, we decide to vary only the value of $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}}$ and $ \varepsilon_{\variabile{p}_1}^{\textrm{min}}$ that determine the number of triangles close to the boundaries fixing the values of $ \varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{max}}$ and $ \varepsilon_{\variabile{p}_1}^{\textrm{max}}$ as they are responsible of the number of rays inside the regions \set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$. Every ray traced has initial position coordinate $\variabile{q}_1\in[-\variabile{a}, \variabile{a}]$ with $\variabile{a}=2$ and the initial direction coordinate $\variabile{p}_1=[-1.1]$. Therefore, the source PS of the TIR-collimator is the rectangular \set{S}{}{}$= [-2, 2] \times [-1, 1]$. The parameters $\varepsilon_{\variabile{p}_1}^{\textrm{min}}$ and $\varepsilon_{\variabile{p}_1}^{\textrm{max}}$ are scaled as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:scaled_parameters}
\begin{aligned}
& w = \frac{\variabile{p}_1^{\textrm{max}}-\variabile{p}_1^{\textrm{min}}}{\variabile{q}_1^{\textrm{max}}-\variabile{q}_1^{\textrm{min}}}=2,\\
&\varepsilon_{\variabile{p}_1}^{\textrm{min}}= \frac{\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}}}{w}, \\
&\varepsilon_{\variabile{p}_1}^{\textrm{max}}= \frac{\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{max}}}{w}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\\ \indent To determine the triangulation refinement that gives a good approximation of the target intensity we compare $U_1$ (source \'{e}tendue) to $U_{\textrm{t}}$ (target \'{e}tendue) and use \'{e}tendue conservation property. Now, not all light emitted by the source of the TIR-collimator arrives at the target. Indeed, using PS ray tracing, $\npath=7$ different paths $(\Pi_\lineai)_{\lineai=1, \cdots, \npath}$ are found but only five of them are paths from the source (line $1$) to the target (line $12$), see also Section \ref{sec:results-Tir-alpha}. Thus, we need to remove from the total area of \set{S}{}{} those parts occupied by the rays that arrive at some others detectors and not at the target. % white areas in figure...
The source PS is therefore given by:
\begin{equation}
U_1 = 8-2A_T\approx 7.77.
\end{equation}
The target \'{e}tendue $U_{\textrm{t}}$ is obtained from Equation (\ref{eq:etenduetarg}) for a range of values of $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}}$ and for $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{max}}=1$ fixed. Likewise, the two-faceted cup, the boundaries $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$ are found for every value of $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}}$, and $U_{\textrm{t}}$ is calculated for each of these boundaries. 
The results shown in Figure \ref{fig:etendue_tir_triangulation} give the \'{e}tendue plot a function of $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_{1}^{\textrm{min}}}$.

  \label{fig:etendue_tir_triangulation}
\end{figure}
\\ \indent 
The best approximation of $U_{\textrm{t}}$ shown in the previous graph is obtained using $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}}=1.6\cdot 10^{-3}$ in the triangulation refinement tracing around $1.62 \cdot 10^5$ rays. The boundaries $\partial\mbox{\set{R}{$1$}{}}(\Pi_{\lineai})$ and $\big(\partial\mbox{\set{R}{}{}}(\Pi_{\lineai})\big)_{\lineai = 1, \cdots, 5}$ of the regions formed by these rays are shown in Figure \ref{fig:boundaries_TIR_triangulation} with the red lines.

The target PS intensity $\hat{I}_{\textrm{PS}}$ is found and it is compared with a reference intensity $\hat{I}_{\textrm{ref}}$ which is given by QMC ray tracing with $10^7$ rays (as the exact intensity for the TIR-collimator is unknown). The profile of the two intensities is given in Figure \ref{fig:intensity_tir_triangulation}. 
The difference between the two intensity profiles is not discernible by eye.

\\ \indent
To validate our method, PS ray tracing is compared to both MC and QMC ray tracing. The error between the approximated intensities $\hat{I}_{\textrm{A}} (\textrm{A}=\textrm{QMC}, \textrm{MC}, \textrm{PS})$ and the reference intensity $\hat{I}_{\textrm{ref}}$ as a function of the number of rays traced is calculated. The error plot is shown in a logarithmic scale in Figure \ref{fig:error_tir_triangulation} where the green line shows the MC, QMC and PS convergences are shown with the green, the blue and the red line, respectively. The black dotted line is a line with slope $-\frac{1}{2}$, the blue dotted line has slope $-1$.The graph shows that MC ray tracing converges with an order of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\nrays}})$, while both PS ray tracing and QMC have a speed of convergence of the order $O(\frac{1}{N})$. Note that PS ray tracing allows tracing $10^2$ times less rays compared to MC ray tracing and around $10$ times less rays compared to QMC ray tracing.

We observe that PS ray tracing outperforms both MC and QMC ray tracing. PS ray tracing speed up MC ray tracing by a factor $2$ and QMC ray tracing by a factor $1$.\\ \indent Next we show the result for a system where more than $5$ paths are possible. 
In particular we present the results for an optical system for which multiple reflections between rays and the mirrors can occur.
\section{A Parabolic reflector}
In this section we show an example of a parabolic reflector the design of which is explained in the following. 
Given a Cartesian coordinate system  $(\variabile{x},\variabile{z})$, the two-dimensional system in Figure \ref{fig:PR} is defined in the $(\variabile{x},\variabile{z})$-plane.
 It consists of a source \point{S} (line $1$), a target \point{T} (line $4$) parallel to \point{S} and two reflectors (lines $2$ and $3$) which are arcs of the same parabola. 
  The minimum of the parabola is located at the point with $\variabile{x}$-coordinate equal to $0$. $\point{S}=[\const{-a}, \const{a}]$ (with $\const{a}=2$) and $\point{T}=[-\const{b},\const{b}]$ (with $\const{b}=17$) are lines perpendicular to the optical axis and are located at $\variabile{z}=0$ and $\variabile{z}=40$, respectively.
All the optical lines are located in air, therefore the index of refraction ${n}=1$ for every line.
The optical axis of the system in Figure \ref{fig:PR} corresponds to the \variabile{z}-axis.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{parabolic_reflector}
\caption{\textrm{A parabolic reflector.}  Each line of the system is labeled with a number.
   The source \point{S}$= [2,2]$ (line $1$) is located on the $\variabile{x}$-axis.
   The target \point{T}$= [-17, 17]$ (line $4$) is parallel to the source and is located at a height $ \variabile{z}= 40$.
   The left and right reflectors (lines $2$ and $3$) are arcs of the same parabola.}
\label{fig:PR}
\end{figure}
We trace rays in PS with source direction coordinates $\variabile{p}_1 = [-1,1]$ and source position coordinates $\variabile{q}_1\in[-\variabile{a}+\varepsilon,\variabile{a}-\varepsilon]$ where $\varepsilon>0$ is a small number. In particular we take $\varepsilon = 10^{-12}$.\\ \indent As an example we show the triangulation refinement obtained from the parameters $$\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}} = 0.025, \; \varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{max}} = 0.25, \; \varepsilon_{\variabile{p}_1}^{\textrm{max}} = \varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}}/2, \mbox{ and }  \varepsilon_{\variabile{p}_1}^{\textrm{max}} = \varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{max}}/2, $$ for which around $7700$ rays are traced in PS. Their distribution at \set{S}{}{} and \set{T}{}{} is shown in Figures \ref{fig:source_triang_pr} and \ref{fig:target_triang_pr}, respectively.

 \label{fig:phase_space_pr}
\end{figure}\\ 
The distribution of the rays in PS gives information about the path they follow. We note that for the parabolic reflector many paths are found. Every path corresponds to a given number of reflections. Rays can have multiple reflections before arrive at the target. These are the rays that leaves the end points of the source with direction tangential to the mirrors $2$ and $3$. The parameters used in the triangulation refinement establish not only the number of rays traced but also the number of paths detected. For instance, for the values of the parameters defined above, the triangulation refinement is able to detect $17$ different paths.  Rays that reflect many times before reaching the target do not give a significant contribution to the target intensity. Decreasing the values of the parameter $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}}$ more paths can be found. In order to find \textit{all} the possible paths, also the parameter $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{max}}$ needs to be decreased. In fact, very small regions cannot be detected if $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{max}}$ is too large, see the example shown in Figure \ref{fig:region inside}. Increasing the number of reflections considered, the corresponding regions in PS are smaller and smaller, see Figure \ref{fig:phase_space_pr}. \\ \indent Likewise the optical systems considered in the previous sections, a stopping criterion of the triangulation refinement is determined for the parabolic reflector. Etendue conservation is used in order to find the values of the parameters that give the best approximation of the boundaries of the regions with positive luminance in PS. For the parabolic reflector in Figure \ref{fig:PR} all the rays that leave the source arrive at the target. Indeed, line $2$ and $3$ can only reflect rays (refraction law is not involved) and the target coincides with the source. From Equation (\ref{eq:etenduesource}) we obtain:
\begin{equation}
U = U_1 = 4(\variabile{a}-\varepsilon)\approx 8.
\end{equation}
Then, a range of values of $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}}$ and $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{max}}$ is considered (the triangulation parameters for the $\variabile{p}$-axis depend on those for the $\variabile{q}$-axis according to Equation (\ref{eq:scaled_parameters})). For each couple of values, an approximation of the boundaries $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$ is found for every path $\Pi$ as explained at the beginning of this chapter. $U_{\textrm{t}}$ is calculated for the approximated boundaries using Equation (\ref{eq:etenduetarg}). In Table \ref{tab:etendue_pr} we show how the number of rays traced, the paths found and the value for the target \'{e}tendue depend on the triangulation parameters.
We observe that, decreasing $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{min}}$ and $\varepsilon_{\variabile{q}_1}^{\textrm{max}}$ the number of both the rays traced and the paths found increases. A maximum of $17$ different paths are found. Furthermore, the value of $U_{\textrm{t}}$ gets closer and closer to the exact \'{e}tendue $U$.

\\ \indent Using the triangulation refinement that gives the best \'{e}tendue approximation, we calculate the target PS intensity $\hat{I}_{\textrm{PS}}$ from Equation (\ref{eq:PSintensity}).
The intensity profile is shown with the red line in Figure \ref{fig:intensity_pr}. The PS intensity is compared to a reference intensity $\hat{I}_{\textrm{ref}}$ given using QMC ray tracing with $10^7$ rays. $\hat{I}_{\textrm{ref}}$ is depicted Figure \ref{fig:intensity_pr} with the dotted blue line. The graph shows that the two intensities overlap.

Now, our method is compared to both MC and QMC ray tracing. 
The error between the approximate intensities $\hat{I}_{\textrm{A}}(\textrm{A}=\textrm{PS}, \textrm{MC}, \textrm{QMC})$ and the reference intensity is calculated. In Figure \ref{fig:error_rays_pr} the error as a function of the number of rays traced is shown for the three methods.
The green line represents MC error, the blue line pictures the QMC error and the red line depicts PS error. The errors are shown in a logarithmic scale, the dotted black line has slope $-\frac{1}{2}$, the dotted blue line has slope $-1$. Likewise the other systems, MC ray tracing converges proportionally to $\frac{1}{\sqrt{\nrays}}$. QMC ray tracing is proportional to $\frac{1}{\nrays}$. PS ray tracing has a behaviour similar to MC ray tracing until all the possible path are found. Once all the path are detected, PS ray tracing converges proportional to $\frac{1}{\nrays}$. Less rays compared to both MC and QMC ray tracing are needed to trace in PS.

Finally, the error as a function of the CPU-time is shown in Figure \ref{fig:error_time_pr}. The MC, QMC and PS errors are depicted with the green, blue and red line, respectively. We observe that PS ray tracing is $10$ times faster than MC ray tracing. Note that PS ray tracing is faster than QMC ray tracing if an error of around $10^-4$ is desired, for a better accuracy, PS ray tracing becomes slightly slower than QMC ray tracing.

\section{Discussion and conclusions}
In this chapter we presented a method to calculate the boundaries of the regions with positive luminance in PS. This method does not depend on the parameter $\alpha$ needed for the $\alpha$-shape method presented in Chapter \ref{chap:boundaries_alpha}. Indeed, given a triangulation at the source PS, the boundaries are computed joining the vertices of the boundaries triangles, that is triangles crossed by a boundary, that follow the same path. Employing \'{e}tendue conservation, a stopping criterion for the triangulation refinement was developed. We applied the method to three different optical systems: a two-faceted cup, a TIR-collimator, and a parabolic reflector. Numerical results show that PS ray tracing is faster and more accurate than MC ray tracing. Compared to QMC ray tracing we observed accuracy and speed advantages of an order of magnitude with our method for the TIR-collimator. 
For the two-faceted cup, PS ray tracing has a slower convergence compared to QMC ray tracing. For the parabolic reflector PS and QMC ray tracing have similar results.
The insight is that QMC ray tracing performs better than PS ray tracing for very simple optical systems, but the PS approach is more suitable for more complicated optical systems.
\\ \indent In order to further improve PS ray tracing we develop a new method which employs the PS of \textit{all} the optical lines. The approach is explained in the next chapter.
%We claim that PS ray tracing is also more accurate than the ray tracing procedure proposed by Moore (2013), \cite{moore2013methods}.
%The novelty of our approach compared to the method used by Moore, is briefly explained below. First, to compute the output intensity, we employ the phase space of the target. This avoids the use of any interpolation to compute the photometric variables and therefore, more accurate results are obtained.
%Second, in  all rays that leave the source start at the same position and only a sampling angular range is given. In our approach a rectangular source is considered thus, both the angular and spatial coordinates of each ray change. This extra variable can produce very irregular shapes of the regions at target phase space. To overcome this issue, we employ the edge-ray principle and we consider the regions at source phase space where the distribution of the rays is much more regular and the corresponding boundaries are easily computed.
%As a consequence, our procedure is suitable to compute the output intensity as function of both the angular or the spatial coordinates.
%Third, using the conservation of \'{e}tendue, we provided a criterion to stop the triangulation refinement. In this way we can estimate the number of rays required to obtain the desired accuracy and thus, we avoid tracing more rays than necessary.
