\chapter{Ray tracing on phase space} \label{chap:PS}
Ray tracing on phase space is a method which employs the phase space (PS) of the source and the target of the optical systems. 
Moreover, it takes into account of the trajectory that every ray follows during its propagation.
%We show through this chapter that this allows to trace only the rays close to the discontinuity of the luminance.
Before explaining the method, we need to introduce the PS concept.
\section{Phase space concept}
The PS of a three-dimensional systems is a four-dimensional space, indeed every ray is described by two position coordinates
and two direction coordinates.
The two position coordinates are given by two of the coordinates of the intersection point of the ray with the surface, while the two direction coordinates are
the momentum coordinates of the vector tangent to the ray projected on the optical surface, \cite{wolf2004geometric}.
\\ \indent For two-dimensional systems every ray in PS is given by a point in a plane.
Given an optical line $\lineai$, the ray position coordinate on PS is the \variabile{x}-coordinate of the intersection point between the ray and line $\lineai$.
The direction coordinate is the sine of the angle that the ray forms with respect to the normal of line $\lineai$ multiplied by the index of refraction of the medium in which the ray is located.
We indicate the PS with \set{S}{}{}$=$\set{Q}{}{}$\times$\set{P}{}{},
where \set{Q}{}{} is the set of the position coordinates \variabile{q} and \set{P}{}{} is the set of the direction coordinates $\variabile{p}=\variabile{n}\sin{\myangle}$, with $\myangle$ the angle between the ray and the normal \vect{$\boldsymbol{\nu}$} of the line and \variabile{n} the index of refraction of the medium in which the line is located.  
The normal \vect{$\boldsymbol{\nu}$} is always directed inside the same medium in which the incident ray travels and, 
the angle $\myangle$ between the ray and \vect{$\boldsymbol{\nu}$} is measured counterclockwise.
In the following, the phase space is considered only for the source $\point{S}$ and the target $\point{T}$ and for no other line of the optical system.
The coordinates of every ray on \set{S}{}{} and \set{T}{}{} are indicated with $(\variabile{q}_1,\variabile{p}_1)$ and $(\variabile{q},\variabile{p})$, respectively.\\ \indent

 \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
To provide an example, we show the source and target PS of the two-faceted cup depicted in Figure \ref{fig:cup}. 
They are given in Figures \ref{fig:sourcePS} and \ref{fig:targetPS}, respectively. 
A sample of $10^4$ random rays randomly are traced within the system. The initial position and initial direction coordinates of a given ray are the coordinates of a point in 
Figure \ref{fig:sourcePS}.
Using ray tracing, we calculate the coordinates of the rays that arrive at the target which correspond 
to the coordinates of the points depicted in Figure \ref{fig:targetPS}. 
Furthermore, we can store the path that every ray follows, where we refer to a path as the sequence of the lines encountered by the ray. 
In Figures \ref{fig:sourcePS} and \ref{fig:targetPS} a color is associated to every path, hence all the rays that follow the same path are depicted with the same color. 
We note that the source and target phase spaces are partitioned into different regions according to the path $\Pi$ followed by the rays. 
Given a path $\Pi$, the corresponding regions are indicated with \set{R}{$1$}{}$(\Pi)$ and \set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$ at the source and the target PS, respectively. 
Rays that propagate through the two-faceted cup can follow $5$ different paths. They can be emitted from the source and arrive to the target without hitting any other line, that is they follow path $\Pi_1= (1,4)$. These rays are depicted in red in the PS pictures. Some rays can hit the left or the right reflector (line $2$ and $3$, respectively) once, their corresponding paths are $\Pi_2 = (1,2,4)$ and $\Pi_3 = (1,3,4)$, respectively. These rays are the blue and green dots in PS, respectively. Finally, there is the possibility that the rays have to reflections before hit the target. The paths are, therefore, $\Pi_4 = (1,2,3,4)$ and $\Pi_5 = (1,3,2,4)$ and the corresponding rays are the yellow and cyan rays, respectively.  
\\ \indent For the two-faceted cup all the light emitted by the source arrives at the target. Nevertheless, while the source PS is completely covered by rays, some parts of the target PS are not reached by any ray, that is
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\mbox{\set{S}{}{}} &= \bigcup_{\Pi} \mbox{\set{R}{$1$}{}}(\Pi),\\
\mbox{\set{T}{}{}} &\supset \bigcup_{\Pi} \mbox{\set{R}{}{}}(\Pi),
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where the union is over all the possible paths.
This means that, while the luminance at the source PS is positive for any possible position and direction, the luminance at the target PS is positive inside the regions \set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$, for every path $\Pi$, and it is equal to $0$ outside those regions. For this reason, from now on we will refer to \set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$ as the regions with positive luminance.\\ \indent
It is very important to remark that, although \set{S}{}{} and \set{T}{}{} have a different rays distribution, the area covered by the rays is conserved. That is nothing more that the property of energy conservation. Indeed, from (\ref{etendue2d}) we rewrite the \'{e}tendue in PS as:
\begin{equation}
U = \int_{\mbox{\set{Q}{}{}}}\int_{\mbox{\set{P}{}{}}} \textrm{d}\variabile{q}\,\textrm{d}\variabile{p}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, in two-dimensions, \'{e}tendue can be seen as an area in PS.  \'{E}tendue conservation leads to the conservation of the areas of regions with positive luminance.\\ \indent
In order to derive the photometric variables at the target we need to understand where the light ends up, i.e. which parts of the target PS are illuminated by the source.
It is therefore useful to employ a fundamental principle in non-imaging optics which is referred to as "the edge-ray principle". A literature overview of this principle is given in the next paragraph.
\section{The edge-ray principle}
\cite{welford1978problem}.
Ries and Rabl (1994) showed that the boundaries 
$\partial$\set{R}{$1$}{}$(\Pi)$ at the source are mapped into the boundaries $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$ at the target: 
all rays that are neighbors at the source PS remain close to each other at the target PS, \cite{Ries:2}. 
Then, to map one region from \set{S}{}{} to \set{T}{}{} it is sufficient to map the boundary of this region.
%\\ \indent Using the PS concept and the edge-ray principle we develop a new ray-tracing procedure in PS.
\section{Phase space ray tracing}
PS ray tracing takes advantage of the fact that there exists an optical map 
$
\map{M}{}{}: \mbox{\set{S}{}{}} \mapsto \mbox{\set{T}{}{}}
$
 such that
\begin{equation} 
\map{M}{}{}(\variabile{q}_1,\variabile{p}_1)=(\variabile{q},\variabile{p}), 
\end{equation} for every $(\variabile{q}_1,\variabile{p}_1)\in$ \set{S}{}{}. 
For very simple systems, like the two-faceted cup, it is possible to determine an analytic expression for $\map{M}{}{}$ (as explained in Appendix \ref{app:boundariescup}).
This is not the case of most of the optical systems we deal with. In that case it is necessary to implement ray tracing to calculate how light is distributed at the target. 
For some optical systems $\map{M}{}{}$ is not even continuous. 
Given a path $\Pi$, the map $\map{M}{}{}(\Pi)$: \set{R}{$1$}{}$(\Pi)$ $\mapsto$ \set{R}{$4$}{}$(\Pi)$ 
which maps the regions \set{R}{$1$}{}$(\Pi)$ in \set{S}{}{} into the regions \set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$ in \set{T}{}{} is a continuous and bijective map.
  The edge ray principle guarantees that $\map{M}{}{}(\Pi)$ maps \set{R}{$1$}{}$(\Pi)$ into \set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$ preserving topological features. In particular, the boundaries $\partial$\set{R}{$1$}{}$(\Pi)$ are mapped into the boundaries $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$. %, see \cite{Ries, Davies, Minano}.
Employing the maps $\map{M}{}{}(\Pi)$ for all the possible paths $\Pi$, the output photometric variables can be calculated.
\\ \indent The luminance $L(\variabile{q}, \variabile{p})$ at the target PS is given by:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:PSluminance}
L(\variabile{q}, \variabile{p}) &> 0  & \quad \mbox{for } (\variabile{q}, \variabile{p})\in \mbox{\set{R}{}{}}(\Pi),\\ \vspace{0.5 cm}
L(\variabile{q}, \variabile{p}) &= 0 & \mbox{otherwise},\qquad \quad \;\;
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
for some path $\Pi$. Since the luminance is conserved along a ray and a Lambertian source is considered, the luminance is constant inside the regions \set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$.
The target intensity along a given direction $\variabile{p}=\const{const}$ is computed through an integration of the target luminance $L(\variabile{q}, \variabile{p})$ and it is defined in \set{T}{}{}$\,$ by:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:PSintensity}
I_{PS}(\variabile{p}) = \int_{\mbox{\set{Q}{}{}}}L(\variabile{q}, \variabile{p}) \textrm{d}\variabile{q}.
\end{equation}
The previous equation implies that, assuming a Lambertian source, the problem of computing the target intensity is reduced to the problem of calculating the boundaries 
$\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$ for all the possible paths $\Pi$. Indicating with $\variabile{q}^\textrm{min}(\Pi,\variabile{p})$ and $\variabile{q}^\textrm{max}(\Pi,\variabile{p})$ the minimum and the maximum position coordinates of the rays located on the boundary \set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$ and using Eq. (\ref{eq:PSluminace}), Eq. (\ref{eq:PSintensity}) reduces to:
\begin{equation}\label{eta2}
I_{PS}(\variabile{p}) = \sum_{\Pi}\int_{\variabile{q}^\textrm{\,min}(\Pi, \variabile{p})}^{\variabile{q}^\textrm{\,max}(\Pi,\variabile{p})}L(\variabile{q}, \variabile{p})\textrm{d}\variabile{q} = \sum_{\Pi}\big (\variabile{q}^\textrm{max}(\Pi,\variabile{p})-\variabile{q}^\textrm{\,min}(\Pi,\variabile{p})\big )\,,
\end{equation}
where the sum is over all the possible paths and the second equation holds as we assume $L=1$ in \set{R}{}{}($\Pi$). 
Note that for a given ray with corresponding coordinates 
on \set{T}{$4$}{}, only one path is possible as we are assuming that all the lines are reflective lines.
Because of this, all the regions \set{R}{}{}($\Pi$) do not overlap each other, i.e. 
\begin{equation}
\bigcap_{\Pi}\mbox{\set{R}{}{}}(\Pi)= \emptyset,
\end{equation}
where the intersection is over all the possible paths. \\ \indent
The definitions of the photometric variables in PS give the insight that using the structure of the PS we could trace less rays inside the system to obtain, for instance, the profile of the target intensity. Instead of tracing the rays randomly (as in MC ray tracing) or following a regular source distribution (as in QMC ray tracing) we would like to construct a ray tracing procedure that allow us tracing more rays close to the discontinuity of the luminance, that is close to the boundaries $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$, and far fewer rays inside the regions $\partial$\set{R}{}{}$(\Pi)$. \\ \indent
The regions $(R_{\textrm{t}, \Pi_j})_{j =1, \cdots, p}$ can be defined only when some rays are traced.
Given an initial set of rays, the rays closest to the boundaries $(\partial R_{\textrm{t}, \Pi_j})_{j = 1, \cdots, p}$ are selected and more rays in their vicinity are created to get progressively better estimates of the boundaries. A more detailed description is provided below.
A triangulation in $\mathcal{P}_\textrm{s}$ is defined and a ray from every vertex $(x_k, \tau_k)$ of the triangle is traced.
The procedure starts tracing four rays with coordinates $(x_k,\tau_k)_{k=1, \cdots, 4}$ that are located exactly at the corners of $\mathcal{P}_\textrm{s}$ and, for each of them, the paths $(\Pi_{j})_{j = 1, \cdots, 4}$, are stored. Next, for some $j \in\{1, \cdots, 4\}$, the grid is divided into two equal triangles joining two opposite vertices. For each triangle the rays located at its corners are traced. If the paths corresponding to
those rays are different, one or more boundaries
$(\partial R_{\textrm{t}, \Pi_j})_{j =1, \cdots, 4}$ are expected to cross the triangle.
In that case, the middle points $(x_k, \tau_k)_{k = 5, 6, 7}$ of each side of the triangle are added and
three more rays with coordinates $(x_k, \tau_k)_{k = 5, 6,7}$ are traced. Each refinement step leads to four new triangles (see Figure \ref{fig:refinement}).
 \begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=8cm]{region}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Triangulation refinement:
  when the rays related to the vertices of the triangles follow a different path a new refinement step is required.
   Each refinement step leads to four new triangles.
   The parameters values are $\epsilon_{x_{max}}~=~ 2$, $\epsilon_{\tau_{max}}= 1$, $\epsilon_{x_{min}}= 4$ and $\epsilon_{\tau_{min}}=2$.}
  \label{fig:refinement}
\end{figure}
  \\ \indent
When all the rays in the corners of each triangle have the same path, it is not necessary to refine the triangles anymore.
\noindent Note that it can happen that a region formed by rays that follow a path $\Pi_j$ is located completely inside a triangle whose vertices are related to the same path $\Pi_i$ with $j \neq i$. In that case the algorithm is not able to detect that region, see Figure \ref{fig:region inside}. To avoid this, two parameters $\epsilon_{x_{min}}$ and $\epsilon_{\tau_{min}}$ are defined for the $x$-axis and the $\tau$-axis, respectively. When the length of the sides of the triangle are greater than these parameters, a new triangle is defined even if its vertices correspond to the same path. Furthermore, two other parameters $\epsilon_{x_{max}}$ and $\epsilon_{\tau_{max}}$ are introduced to defined a stopping criterion.
The algorithm stops when the length of the sides of the triangles is smaller than $\epsilon_{x_{max}}$ and $\epsilon_{\tau_{max}}$.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=8cm]{region_inside}
  \end{center}
  \caption{The red line encloses a region of rays that follow the path $\Pi_2$ and is completely located inside a triangle.
  The algorithm is not able to detect that region and, a further refinement is required.
    The parameters values are $\epsilon_{x_{max}}~=~ 2$, $\epsilon_{\tau_{max}}= 1$, $\epsilon_{x_{min}}= 4$ and $\epsilon_{\tau_{min}}=2$. }
   \label{fig:region inside}
  \end{figure}
The values of the parameters $\epsilon_{x_{max}}$, $\epsilon_{\tau_{max}}$, $\epsilon_{x_{min}}$ and $\epsilon_{\tau_{min}}$ determine the number of rays traced.
Indeed, on the one hand, $\epsilon_{x_{max}}$ and $\epsilon_{\tau_{max}}$ can be decreased to obtain more rays close to the boundaries;
on the other hand, a large number of rays in the interior of the regions can be traced decreasing the values of $\epsilon_{x_{min}}$ and $\epsilon_{\tau_{min}}$. %
\newline
\indent Using the above procedure, rays increasingly closer to the boundaries are traced.
For our optical system, the width of the $x$-axis in source phase space is two times the width of the $\tau$-axis.
Thus, our choice is $\epsilon_{\tau_{min}}=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{x_{min}}$ and $\epsilon_{\tau_{max}} = \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{x_{max}}$.
Figure \ref{fig:triangulation_refinement} shows an example of a triangulation refinement of the source phase space with $\epsilon_{x_{max}}=0.1$ and $\epsilon_{x_{min}}=1$.
The triangulation refinement provides more triangles close to the boundaries $\partial R_{\textrm{s}, \Pi_j}$ than those inside the regions $R_{\textrm{s}, \Pi_j}$.

  \end{figure}
 \\ \indent The paths $(\Pi_j)_{j = 1, \cdots, p}$ followed by the rays located at the corner of the triangles are computed during the procedure and, the regions
 $R_{\textrm{s}, \Pi_j}$ and $R_{\textrm{t}, \Pi_j}$ are defined for each $\Pi_j$.
Next, a criterion to select the values of the parameters $\epsilon_{x_{min}}$ and $\epsilon_{x_{max}}$ and a method to compute the boundaries $\partial{R_{t, \Pi_j}}$ is provided.
Furthermore, the output photometric variables are computed, the details are explained in the next section.



\section{Comparison between MC, QMC and PS ray tracing}

% Compare all the PS
% Definition of luminance intensity and etendue

\indent A similar method as described in this chapter is presented by Moore, \cite{moore2013methods}. In Moore's method each ray leaves the source at the same position while the angle coordinate changes. The path followed by the rays is taken into account and an interpolation is required to finalize the illumination pattern.
 This interpolation can affect the efficiency of the method. Our method employs the distribution of the rays at the target phase space and avoids using any interpolation. 
Moreover, a criterion to stop the algorithm is provided in such a way that no more rays than necessary are traced. This makes ray tracing in phase space more accurate compared with Moore's procedure.
 Finally, we claim that PS ray tracing is also more accurate than the ray tracing procedure proposed by Moore (2013), \cite{moore2013methods}.
The novelty of our approach compared to the method used by Moore, is briefly explained below.
First, to compute the output intensity, we employ the phase space of the target. This avoids the use of any interpolation to compute the photometric variables and therefore, more accurate results are obtained.
Second, in \cite{moore2013methods} all rays that leave the source start at the same position and only a sampling angular range is given. In our approach a rectangular source is considered thus, both the angular and spatial coordinates of each ray change. This extra variable can produce very irregular shapes of the regions at target phase space. To overcome this issue, we employ the edge-ray principle and we consider the regions at source phase space where the distribution of the rays is much more regular and the corresponding boundaries are easily computed.
As a consequence, our procedure is suitable to compute the output intensity as function of both the angular or the spatial coordinates.


% We need to compute the boundaries, explained in next chapter
